## Additional Required Setup (Please Read!)

## Android 
In  your BaseActivity or MainActivity (for Xamarin.Forms) add this code:

Add usings:

using Plugin.Permissions;
using Plugin.Permissions.Abstractions;

Then add to Activity:

public override void OnRequestPermissionsResult(int requestCode, string[] permissions, Permission[] grantResults)
{
    PermissionsImplementation.Current.OnRequestPermissionsResult(requestCode, permissions, grantResults);
}

The `WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE`, `READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` permissions are required, but the library will automatically add this for you. Additionally, if your users are running Marshmallow the Plugin will automatically prompt them for runtime permissions.

Additionally, the following has been added for you:
[assembly: UsesFeature("android.hardware.camera", Required = false)]
[assembly: UsesFeature("android.hardware.camera.autofocus", Required = false)]

**ANDROID N**
If your application targets Android N (API 24) or newer, you must use version 2.6.0+.

You must also add a few additional configuration files to adhere to the new strict mode:

1.) Add the following to your AndroidManifest.xml inside the <application> tags:

<provider android:name="android.support.v4.content.FileProvider" 
				android:authorities="YOUR_APP_PACKAGE_NAME.fileprovider" 
				android:exported="false" 
				android:grantUriPermissions="true">
			<meta-data android:name="android.support.FILE_PROVIDER_PATHS" 
				android:resource="@xml/file_paths"></meta-data>
</provider>

YOUR_APP_PACKAGE_NAME must be set to your app package name!

2.) Add a new folder called xml into your Resources folder and add a new XML file called `file_paths.xml`

Add the following code:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<paths xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android">
    <external-files-path name="my_images" path="Pictures" />
    <external-files-path name="my_movies" path="Movies" />
</paths>

YOUR_APP_PACKAGE_NAME must be set to your app package name!

## Android Current Activity Setup

This plugin uses the [Current Activity Plugin](https://github.com/jamesmontemagno/CurrentActivityPlugin/blob/master/README.md) to get access to the current Android Activity. Be sure to complete the full setup if a MainApplication.cs file was not automatically added to your application. Please fully read through the [Current Activity Plugin Documentation](https://github.com/jamesmontemagno/CurrentActivityPlugin/blob/master/README.md). At an absolute minimum you must set the following in your Activity's OnCreate method:

```csharp
Plugin.CurrentActivity.CrossCurrentActivity.Current.Activity = this;
```

It is highly recommended that you use a custom Application that are outlined in the Current Activity Plugin Documentation](https://github.com/jamesmontemagno/CurrentActivityPlugin/blob/master/README.md)

### iOS

Your app is required to have keys in your Info.plist for `NSCameraUsageDescription` and `NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription` in order to access the device's camera and photo/video library. If you are using the Video capabilities of the library then you must also add `NSMicrophoneUsageDescription`.  The string that you provide for each of these keys will be displayed to the user when they are prompted to provide permission to access these device features. You can read me here: https://blog.xamarin.com/new-ios-10-privacy-permission-settings/

Such as:
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app needs access to the camera to take photos.</string>
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app needs access to photos.</string>
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app needs access to microphone.</string>
<key>NSPhotoLibraryAddUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app needs access to the photo gallery.</string>

### UWP
